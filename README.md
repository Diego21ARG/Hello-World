# Hello-World
# First repository
# My name is Diego, I'm an EFL, ELectronics teacher from Argentina doing its first work on Arduino because we are planning to start teaching it to students :-)
# Never had the resources to play with it in my home since Arduino boards are kind of expensive in my country, so I'm happy that I can do it now in my school and I'm eager to teach and learn along my students
